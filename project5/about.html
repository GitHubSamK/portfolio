        <h2>About the Inn</h2>

        <div class="aboutinn">
            <p>
                The Inn – Relax and Refresh at our B&B in Provincetown Village.
                All seven air-conditioned rooms have queen or king-size beds with luxurious linens, cozy sitting areas, and private baths en suite complete with fresh flowers, chocolates, robes, and a basket of amenities. Each has a fireplace or stove, and several have whirlpool baths.
                
            </p> 
            <p> 
                The common areas invite you to relax by the fire, savor a glass of sherry or port, and visit with your friends or fellow guests.
            </p> 
            <p>
                The main house and the carriage house each have a variety of room styles to fit your needs, whether you’re looking for a romantic and cozy room for two or family accommodations for up to four.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Provincetown Village is a perfect location for strolling and exploring the shops, museums, and restaurants that are unique to our town.  The Provincetown boardwalk is a short walk from the inn where you can enjoy the beauty of the salt marsh and views across Cape Cod Bay.
